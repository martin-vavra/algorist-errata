Page 445, Problem description and Order statistics (last bullet)
These two do not match. One possible definition:
Problem description: Find the key greater than or equal to exactly k of the n keys.
Order statistics:
- smallest ... k = 1
- largest .... k = n
- median ..... k = n/2

Page 446, line 11,
It should be noted that the described algorithm is called quick-select.

Page 447, line -5, "lower bower bound" > "lower bound"

Page 450, (Section 14.4), "swap[...]" should probably be "swap(...)"

Page 454, first bullet point should be "k-subsets" (lower K)

Page 506, line 13, "whose the vertices" > "whose vertices"

(*) Page 510, maximum flow equation, The equation won't work with the given definition of x_ij.
The definition should be should be extended to cover the case when there is no such edge (i,j) and in that case x_ij=0.

Page 535, second bullet point, line 5, "such that" > "such that:"

Page 535, the max min formula in the middle of the page,
The upper limit of the min function should probably be |T| - 1 because we use v_i+1.
This however still does not cover the case where we have exactly 1 item in the partial tour T,
which should probably be covered separately by using a formula with just MAX.
